# Project Overview

As an MSc student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science with a background in finance, my final year project delved into the intersection of finance and data science. This project held immense personal significance, allowing me to seamlessly navigate the realms of data science and finance.

## Project Context

In the contemporary business landscape, corporations recognize the strategic importance of managing their reputation in the era of real-time data. The perspectives of employees, clients, suppliers, and users can significantly impact a company's image. Corporates are increasingly vigilant about uncontrolled information dissemination and opinions within online communities. Furthermore, understanding and assessing reputations have become crucial for valuing intangible assets and garnering financial support.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this study was to employ sentiment analysis techniques to gauge public opinion about Tesla. The specific research questions addressed include:

1. **Geographical Sentiment Analysis:**
   - What is the prevailing sentiment on Twitter across different geographical regions?

2. **Temporal Sentiment Analysis:**
   - How have sentiments towards Tesla evolved over specific time periods?

3. **Correlation with Stock Market Performance:**
   - Is there a correlation between sentiment towards Tesla and its stock market performance?

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Is the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models generally better than DL and Transformer models when classifying sentiment from tweets?

## Resources Used

The project leveraged the following resources:

- **Twitter Data:**
  - Collection of tweets from Twitter to capture real-time public sentiment.

- **Stock Market Data:**
  - Utilization of stock data from Yahoo Finance to correlate sentiment with market performance.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
  - DL-Bi-LSTM (Deep Learning with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) with embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.

- **Transformer Model:**
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).


## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the dynamic relationship between public sentiment, geographical variations, and stock market performance, employing advanced sentiment analysis techniques. The utilization of both traditional ML models and cutting-edge Transformer models enriches the methodological depth of the study.
